# craftmake

**A native workflow executor for compiling versioned YAML into reproducible task runs.**

Craftmake builds a task DAG, executes it locally or through SLURM, persists state in SQLite, and exposes plan, run, resume, cancel, logs, reports, caching, and artifact-aware recovery. It is the execution layer being integrated into `otter`.

## What it provides

- Versioned workflow YAML and deterministic catalog routing.
- Lightweight Action workflow mode (`craftmake action`) with strict parameter contracts (`${{ args.* }}`, `${{ env.* }}`, `${{ config.* }}`).
- Google Colab remote execution backend with Jupyter WebSocket kernel protocol, automatic quota recovery (HTTP 412), and zero resource leakage.
- Native Google Drive persistent mounting (`/content/drive/MyDrive/...`) with cloud write flushing.
- Local execution with CPU, memory, and parallelism admission budgets.
- Native SLURM submission with task-level resource envelopes and accounting refresh.
- SQLite run/task/submission state, cache decisions, resume, cancellation, and reports.
- Immutable `otter.run/v1` input/reference boundary and create-only artifact publication.
- Structured run IDs, JSON output, failure classification, and reproducible evidence.

## Where it fits

```text
otter project/config → immutable run.yaml → craftmake → enva/operators → results manifest
```

Craftmake can also run a strict `craftmake.standalone/v1` DAG. It does not create Otter projects or replace domain-specific configuration and sample validation.

## Current boundary

Craftmake is the native executor under integration. Existing Otter production workflows still have an explicit Snakemake compatibility path; Craftmake is not an embedded Snakemake interpreter and is not an automatic fallback.

The accepted Gate 6 evidence is bounded. It covers executor parity and selected recovery/publication behavior for RRBS, RNA-seq, BS-PDX, and RNA-PDX. Fresh seven-input matrix work, representative repeats, production-scale qualification, and WGBS qualification remain deferred and must not be presented as completed.

## Install and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rainoffallingstar/craftmake.git
cd craftmake
make build
./build/craftmake --help
```

Install to a prefix:

```bash
sudo make install PREFIX="/usr/local"
```

## Controller contract

The Craftmake controller is the supported control plane for every canonical run. It validates the immutable `run.yaml`, compiles the selected catalog phase, schedules tasks, persists SQLite state and `controller.jsonl`, reconciles SLURM accounting, handles resume/cancel, and publishes validated artifacts. Direct hand-written `sbatch` orchestration is not a substitute for controller execution.


```bash
craftmake doctor --backend local
craftmake doctor --backend slurm

craftmake plan \
  --config /analysis/runs/run-20260905T010203Z-abcdef/run.yaml \
  --phase step1 \
  --catalog workflows/

craftmake run \
  --config /analysis/runs/run-20260905T010203Z-abcdef/run.yaml \
  --phase step1 \
  --backend local \
  --workers 4 \
  --max-cores 16 \
  --max-memory 64G
```

Resume and inspect a run:

```bash
craftmake resume --state /analysis/runs/<run-id>/state/state.sqlite --run <run-id>
craftmake report --state-dir /analysis/runs/<run-id>/state
craftmake cancel --state-dir /analysis/runs/<run-id>/state
```

## Action workflows and Google Colab execution

Craftmake provides a lightweight **Action workflow mode** and a **Google Colab remote execution backend** with native Google Drive integration.

### Action workflow mode (`craftmake action`)

Action workflows live in flat `.craftmake/*.yaml` files in your project directory using the `craftmake.action/v1` schema.

```yaml
# .craftmake/hello.yaml
schema_version: craftmake.action/v1
name: hello
backend: colab                  # default backend: local or colab
inputs:
  who:
    default: world
jobs:
  greet:
    steps:
      - run: echo "hello ${{ args.who }} from colab"
```

#### Parameter source contracts

Parameter substitutions enforce strict, explicit source namespaces:

- `${{ args.<name> }}`: Explicit CLI arguments passed via `--arg KEY=VALUE` (or `--input`). Validated against action `inputs` declarations.
- `${{ env.<NAME> }}`: Read-only snapshot of environment variables captured at execution start.
- `${{ config.<name> }}`: Values from an associated workflow configuration file.

#### Action CLI commands

```bash
# List available actions discovered under .craftmake/
craftmake action list

# Compile and preview execution plan without running
craftmake action plan hello --arg who=Craftmake

# Execute action locally
craftmake action run hello --backend local --arg who=World

# Execute action on Google Colab with a configured session
craftmake action run hello --backend colab --colab-session gpu --arg who=World
```

---

### Google Colab remote backend

The `colab` backend executes tasks on real Google Cloud Colab CPU and GPU runtimes without external dependencies or heavy toolchains.

#### Architectural highlights

- **Standard Library RFC 6455 WebSocket**: Uses a minimal, pure Go RFC 6455 client supporting transparent TLS (`wss://`), custom proxy token headers (`X-Colab-Runtime-Proxy-Token`), and client identification (`X-Colab-Client-Agent: vscode`).
- **Jupyter Kernel Protocol**: Connects to the Colab runtime proxy WebSocket channels (`/api/kernels/<kernel_id>/channels`), manages `execute_request`, parses `stream`, `display_data`, and `error` envelopes, and coordinates graceful kernel interruption.
- **Dynamic Kernel Discovery**: Queries `GET /api/kernels` or initializes sessions via `POST /api/sessions` / `POST /api/kernels` with automatic fallback.
- **Zero Resource Leakage**: Enforces strict lifecycle management—machines are assigned on `BeginRun` and automatically released with verified unassign choreography on `EndRun`.
- **412 Quota Recovery**: Detects Google Colab free-tier concurrent assignment limits (HTTP 412 `TooManyAssignmentsError`), scans existing dangling assignments, and cleans them up automatically before retrying.
- **Local Observability Materialization**: Real-time streams from Jupyter cells are captured and written to local task log files (`step-0.stdout`, `step-0.stderr`) and `result.json` in the state directory.

### Session authentication & management

Colab sessions store credentials and Drive mount preferences in `~/.config/craftmake/colab-auth.json` (0600 file permissions).

#### 1. Interactive OAuth Login

```bash
# Login via browser OAuth loopback flow
craftmake colab auth login --session gpu
```

- Binds an ephemeral local port on `127.0.0.1`.
- Uses Google's built-in Colab OAuth client with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/colaboratory` scope.
- Automatically stores the refresh token in `~/.config/craftmake/credentials/<session>.json` (`0600`).
- **Login once, run indefinitely**: Subsequent runs transparently refresh access tokens in under 0.5s without browser prompts.

#### 2. Inspect and Check Health

```bash
# View non-secret session configuration
craftmake colab auth show --session gpu

# Check offline session readiness and credential files
craftmake colab doctor --session gpu
```

---

### Google Drive integration

Craftmake supports mounting your personal Google Drive as a durable remote workspace (`/content/drive/MyDrive/<root>`).

#### 1. One-time Drive Authorization

Google Colab requires explicit user consent to access Google Drive files. Authorize once per account:

```bash
# Trigger interactive Drive mount authorization
craftmake colab drive mount --session gpu --authorize
```

1. The CLI displays Google's official Drive authorization URL and opens your default browser.
2. Sign in with your Google account and click **Allow**.
3. Return to the terminal and press **Enter** (or wait for auto-detection).
4. Drive authorization is confirmed and bound.

#### 2. Automatic Mount & Cloud Persistence in Workflows

In your action workflow, files under `/content/drive` are automatically mounted and flushed:

```yaml
# .craftmake/drive_hello.yaml
schema_version: craftmake.action/v1
name: drive_hello
backend: colab
jobs:
  drive_test:
    steps:
      - run: |
          python3 - << 'EOF'
          import os
          from pathlib import Path
          from google.colab import drive

          # Google Drive is auto-mounted by bootstrap when drive_root is configured
          drive_dir = Path('/content/drive/MyDrive/craftmake')
          drive_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

          hello_file = drive_dir / 'helloworld.txt'
          hello_file.write_text('helloworld from craftmake colab!')
          print('Created cloud file:', hello_file)

          # Flush all writes to Google Drive cloud storage
          drive.flush_and_unmount()
          print('Flushed to cloud successfully!')
          EOF
```

Execute the action:

```bash
craftmake action run drive_hello --backend colab --colab-session gpu --force
```

The file is written directly to your Google Drive and is immediately accessible from the web, mobile app, or subsequent workflow runs.

The exact workflow phase, backend, resource envelope, and reference identity for an `otter.run/v1` snapshot are resolved before execution. By default, mutable overrides (`--backend`, `--run-id`, `--partition`, `--account`, `--qos`, `--time`, `--scratch-root`) are allowed. Pass `--gate` to `run` or `resume` to enforce the immutable layer: backend, run identity, and SLURM resources are then fixed to the resolved snapshot and cannot be overridden.

```bash
# Mutable overrides are allowed by default.
craftmake run \
  --config /analysis/runs/run-20260905T010203Z-abcdef/run.yaml \
  --phase step1 \
  --backend local \
  --partition compute

# --gate enforces the immutable snapshot (backend, run id, SLURM resources).
craftmake run \
  --config /analysis/runs/run-20260905T010203Z-abcdef/run.yaml \
  --phase step1 \
  --gate
```

## ReferenceBuild

Craftmake can download, build, and publish an immutable reference genome release through the `ReferenceBuild` workflow. It reads a `reference-build.yaml` configuration and runs the `acquire_sources → prepare_assets → publish_release` DAG, which calls `otter reference build` to publish the standard registry directory.

```bash
craftmake plan \
  --reference-build-config \
  --config reference-build.yaml \
  --workflow workflows/ReferenceBuild/build.yaml \
  --phase build \
  --catalog workflows/

craftmake run \
  --reference-build-config \
  --config reference-build.yaml \
  --workflow workflows/ReferenceBuild/build.yaml \
  --phase build \
  --catalog workflows/ \
  --gate
```

The reference-build backend and partition are configurable in `reference-build.yaml`:

```yaml
reference_build:
  backend: local        # or slurm; default slurm
  partition: ""        # empty uses the site profile / --partition / CRAFTMAKE_SLURM_PARTITION
  # ... fasta/gtf URLs, checksums, registry_root, tool binaries ...
```

A default `reference-build.yaml` template ships in the release archive under `share/craftmake/configs/`. The `--gate` flag keeps the reference-build run immutable; without it, SLURM resources may be overridden.

## Workflow assets

Current catalog families include:

- `BeaverBS` — RRBS/WGBS-compatible bisulfite phases;
- `BeaverRNA` — RNA-seq phases;
- `BeaverPDX` — bisulfite PDX phases;
- `BeaverRNASEQPDX` — RNA-PDX phases;
- `SRAArchiveDecode` — validated archive decode and paired-FASTQ publication.

See [benchmark evidence](doc/benchmarks/README.md) for the reproducible PDX controller-reconciliation dataset and generator.

## Operational limits

- Admission budgets coordinate scheduling; they do not create OS cgroups for child processes.
- SLURM jobs may remain in `COMPLETING`; inspect Craftmake state and `sacct` together.
- A valid manifest is necessary but is not by itself scientific parity.
- Real production-scale throughput is not established by the current bounded evidence.

## Development

```bash
go test ./...
go vet ./...
make benchmark-pdx-scheduler
```

The repository uses Go 1.26.x as declared in `go.mod`. Each source revision is independent from the parent `otter` checkout; update the parent gitlink only when intentionally integrating a new revision.
