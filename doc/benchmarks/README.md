# PDX Scheduler Benchmark: Craftmake and Snakemake Compatibility Executor

## Scope

This directory retains the checked source data, generated summary statistics, and figure for the current repeated PDX scheduler comparison. The experiment measures **controller reconciliation time** for the `step2-check` phase: the elapsed interval from the final worker-job completion to the controller's recorded terminal completion.

The source report is the immutable Paracloud aggregate `gate6-r41-pdx-scheduling-repeat-aggregate-r2`, collected with release `gate6-20260812T104500Z-pdx-host-fasta-r41`. It covers six balanced executor pairs: three `bs-pdx` pairs and three `rna-pdx` pairs. Each pair fixes the scenario, phase, prerequisite content checksums, release, workflow, and Slurm resource envelope; both executors produced matching filtered BAM/BAI checksums and mapped-read counts.

The paired runs are real workflow benchmarks, not topology-identical executor microbenchmarks. Craftmake submitted three worker jobs per PDX cell (two validation tasks and Xenofilx), whereas the Snakemake compatibility projection submitted one worker job. Therefore, task count, queue interaction, and worker makespan describe the observed execution topology. They must not be interpreted as an isolated implementation-speed ranking.

## Results

![Median controller reconciliation time with observed range and paired repeats](pdx-step2-check-controller-reconciliation.svg)

The bars show the median of three paired repeats. Whiskers show the observed minimum and maximum, not a confidence interval. Gray lines join matching repeat numbers. The figure reports an exact two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank p-value; with only three pairs, the smallest attainable two-sided exact p-value is `0.250`, so these data are descriptive and do not establish a conventional statistical-significance claim.

| Scenario | Craftmake median (min–max), s | Snakemake median (min–max), s | Median paired difference, s (Snakemake − Craftmake) | Exact two-sided Wilcoxon p |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| BS-PDX | 4.213 (2.385–5.057) | 19.819 (14.008–164.668) | 15.606 | 0.250 |
| RNA-PDX | 2.651 (1.552–4.308) | 9.478 (8.458–29.556) | 5.807 | 0.250 |

Within this specific release, compatibility projection, PDX `step2-check` phase, and Paracloud Slurm environment, the observed Craftmake controller-reconciliation intervals were lower and narrower than the corresponding Snakemake intervals. The experiment does not attribute that behavior to a particular internal mechanism, does not compare topology-identical DAGs, and does not establish general throughput or production-scale performance. Queue delay remains a separate scheduler/site metric and is not used for this conclusion.

## Next gates

This benchmark is a completed, bounded Craftmake-versus-Snakemake executor comparison. It is not an ongoing Snakemake workstream and does not imply a general throughput ranking or a fresh seven-input legacy-equivalent scientific matrix.

The current Gate 6 closeout actions are limited to reviewing the [closeout evidence register](../../../docs/gate6-closeout-evidence-register.json), recording the final decision log, and performing conditional BS-PDX publication/artifact verification if formal publication is required. Representative repeats, production-scale qualification, WGBS requalification, and additional Snakemake interruption/recovery are deferred non-blocking extensions.

Regenerate the derived CSV and SVG from the repository root:

```bash
python3 craftmake/scripts/generate_pdx_scheduler_benchmark.py \
  --source craftmake/doc/benchmarks/gate6-r41-pdx-scheduling-repeat-aggregate-r2.source.json \
  --summary-csv craftmake/doc/benchmarks/pdx-step2-check-controller-reconciliation-summary.csv \
  --figure-svg craftmake/doc/benchmarks/pdx-step2-check-controller-reconciliation.svg
```

The generator verifies the source SHA-256, expected r41 release, the two PDX scenarios, and exactly three complete Craftmake/Snakemake repeat pairs per scenario before it writes output. It requires Python 3 with `matplotlib` and `scipy`.
